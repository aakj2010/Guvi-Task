Statically typed language:
        Statically typed programming languages do type checking(i.e, the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types) at compile-time as opposed run-time.

        Examples : Java, C, C++

Dynamically typed language:
        Dynamically typed programming languages do type checking at run-time as opposed to compile-time.

        Examples : Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavScript


Scripted language:
        Scripted languages are interpreted within another program. JavScript is embedded within a browser and interpreted by that browser.

        Examples : JavScript, Python

Advantages of Scripting language:
        1.Simple -- Scripting languages are esier to write than a programming language.
        2.Fewer lines code 

Programming languages:
        Programming languages are like Java are compiled and not interpreted by another application in the same way.

        Examples: C, C++, Java




























HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
*****************

HTTP 1.1
********
1.HTTP 1.1 is less efficient when compared to HTTP2
2.It is slower than HTTP2 in terms of site loading
3.It Does not allow PUSH.
4.HTTP1.1 loads resourse one after other,so if one resourse cant loaded,it blocks all other resourses behind it.
5.It keeps all requets and response in plain text.
6.Here server only servee contentwhat client ask for it.
7.HTTP1.1 maintains less performance boost compared to other.
8.It Does not use HPACK method.
9.It uses ordered and blocking method.
10.In HTTP1.1 devolopers doesn't have any control over prioritization.
11.It doesn't reduce any additional round-trip times while HTTP2 reduces, meaning websites loading faster with less optimiztion 


HTTP 2
*******
1.HTTP2 is more efficient
2.It is faster than HTTP1.1 in terms of site loading
3.It allows PUSH to response proactively into client cache.
4.HTTP2 is able to use single TCP connection to send multiple Streams of data at once. so that no resourse blocks any other resourse
5.It uses binary farming layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format.
6.By using PUSH,it allows server to serve content before client asks for it. 
7.It maintains great performance boost.
8.It uses most advanced compression method HPACK.
9.HTTP2 is fully muliplexed.
10.In HTTP2 devolopers have deatailed control over prioritization.
11.While HTTP2 reduces additional round-trip times, meaning websites loading faster with less optimiztion
